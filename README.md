# Compass_Overlay
A REALLY simple app to show a compass overlay so I can know East from West on my minimap

Just run it, it should stay above all other windows.

To exit: Right-click and click "Close"

TODO:
- Add resize from corner
- Add a couple different compasses (Currently the blue and orange is ugly but visible)
- Add "Hide" function (And tray icon)
